defmodule Grephql.Generation.Plugins.SkipInclude do
  @moduledoc """
  Built-in generation plugin for the `@include` and `@skip` directives.

  A conditionally-selected field may be omitted from the response, so its
  generated type must be nullable even when the schema says the field is
  non-null. Runtime decode already tolerates the omission; this plugin only
  fixes generated-type accuracy.

  After the `normalize` step has propagated ancestor (inline-fragment /
  fragment-spread) directives onto each field, this plugin walks the
  resolved tree and marks every conditionally-selected field nullable.

  ## Conditionality

  A directive's `if:` argument is a `Grephql.Language.Variable` or a literal
  `Grephql.Language.BooleanValue`:

    * `@include(if: $var)` / `@skip(if: $var)` — conditional (variable).
    * `@include(if: true)` / `@skip(if: false)` — no-op, not conditional.
    * `@include(if: false)` / `@skip(if: true)` — always omitted, but still
      generated as nullable to keep the struct shape stable.

  So `@include` is conditional unless `if:` is literal `true`, and `@skip`
  is conditional unless `if:` is literal `false`.

  List fields (`embeds_many`) are forced to `default: []` downstream, which
  cannot represent whole-absence as `nil`, so their nullability is left
  unchanged (see the type generator docs).
