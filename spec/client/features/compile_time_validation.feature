Feature: Compile-time GraphQL validation
  As an Elixir developer
  I want my GraphQL operations validated against the schema at compile time
  So that I catch query errors before runtime

  # --- Schema Loading ---

  Rule: Schema is loaded at compile time from the configured source

    Scenario: Schema loaded from a local file
      Given a client module configured with source "priv/schemas/service.json"
      And the file contains a valid introspection JSON with a "user" type
      When the module is compiled
      Then the schema is available for validation

    Scenario: Schema loaded from an inline string
      Given a client module configured with an inline introspection JSON source
      When the module is compiled
      Then the schema is available for validation

    Scenario: Schema fetch failure blocks compilation
      Given a client module configured with source "priv/schemas/missing.json"
      And the file does not exist
      When the module is compiled
      Then a compile error is raised indicating the schema could not be loaded

  # --- Operation Structure ---

  Rule: Operations must reference existing root types

    Scenario: Query operation with valid query root type
      Given a schema with a query root type "Query" having field "user"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { name } }"
      Then the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Mutation operation without mutation root type raises compile error
      Given a schema with no mutation root type defined
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "mutation { createUser { id } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating mutation is not supported by the schema

  Rule: Anonymous operations must be singular

    Scenario: Single anonymous operation compiles
      Given a ~GQL with one anonymous query "{ user { name } }"
      When the module is compiled
      Then the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Multiple anonymous operations raise compile error
      Given a ~GQL with two anonymous queries
      When the module is compiled
      Then a compile error is raised indicating only one anonymous operation is allowed

  Rule: Operation names must be unique

    Scenario: Duplicate operation names raise compile error
      Given a ~GQL with two named operations both called "GetUser"
      When the module is compiled
      Then a compile error is raised indicating duplicate operation name "GetUser"

  # --- Field Validation ---

  Rule: Field references are validated against the schema

    Scenario: Valid field selection compiles successfully
      Given a schema with type "User" having fields "name" and "email"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { name email } }"
      Then the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Invalid field reference raises compile error
      Given a schema with type "User" having fields "name" and "email"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { nonExistentField } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "nonExistentField" does not exist on type "User"

  Rule: Scalar fields must not have sub-selections

    Scenario: Sub-selection on scalar raises compile error
      Given a schema where "name" on "User" is of type "String!"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { name { length } } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "name" is a scalar and cannot have sub-selections

  Rule: Composite types must have sub-selections

    Scenario: Missing sub-selection on object type raises compile error
      Given a schema where "user" returns type "User" (an object)
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "user" is an object type and requires a sub-selection

  Rule: Empty selection sets are invalid

    Scenario: Empty selection set raises parse error
      Given a schema with type "User"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { } }"
      Then a compile error is raised with a parse error before "}"
      # Note: the parser grammar requires at least one selection, so this is caught at parse time

  # --- Argument Validation ---

  Rule: Argument names are validated against field definitions

    Scenario: Valid argument compiles
      Given a schema where "user" accepts argument "id" of type "ID!"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user(id: \"123\") { name } }"
      Then the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Non-existent argument raises compile error
      Given a schema where "user" accepts only argument "id"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user(foo: \"bar\") { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "foo" is not a valid argument on "user"

  Rule: Required arguments must be provided

    Scenario: Missing required argument raises compile error
      Given a schema where "user" requires argument "id" of type "ID!"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating required argument "id" is missing on "user"

  Rule: Argument types must match

    Scenario: Argument type mismatch raises compile error
      Given a schema where "user" accepts argument "active" of type "Boolean!"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user(active: \"yes\") { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating type mismatch for argument "active"

    Scenario: Integer literal is compatible with ID type
      Given a schema where "user" accepts argument "id" of type "ID!"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user(id: 123) { name } }"
      Then the module compiles successfully (GraphQL spec allows Int coercion to ID)

  Rule: Arguments must be unique per field

    Scenario: Duplicate argument raises compile error
      Given a schema where "user" accepts argument "id"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user(id: \"1\", id: \"2\") { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating duplicate argument "id" on "user"

  # --- Variable Validation ---

  Rule: Variable types are validated against argument types

    Scenario: Matching variable and argument types compile successfully
      Given a schema where "user" accepts argument "id" of type "ID!"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { name } }"
      Then the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Mismatched variable type raises compile error
      Given a schema where "user" accepts argument "id" of type "ID!"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query($id: String!) { user(id: $id) { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating type mismatch between "String!" and "ID!"

  Rule: All defined variables must be used

    Scenario: Unused variable raises compile error
      Given a ~GQL with "query($id: ID!, $name: String!) { user(id: $id) { name } }"
      When the module is compiled
      Then a compile error is raised indicating variable "$name" is defined but not used

  Rule: All used variables must be defined

    Scenario: Undefined variable raises compile error
      Given a ~GQL with "query($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { posts(limit: $limit) { title } } }"
      When the module is compiled
      Then a compile error is raised indicating variable "$limit" is used but not defined

  Rule: Variable names must be unique

    Scenario: Duplicate variable definition raises compile error
      Given a ~GQL with "query($id: ID!, $id: String!) { user(id: $id) { name } }"
      When the module is compiled
      Then a compile error is raised indicating duplicate variable "$id"

  # --- Directive Validation ---

  Rule: Directives must exist in the schema

    Scenario: Unknown directive raises compile error
      Given a schema with directives "skip" and "include"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user @foo { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating directive "@foo" is not defined

  Rule: Directives must be used in valid locations

    Scenario: Directive in wrong location raises compile error
      Given a schema where "@skip" is allowed on FIELD, FRAGMENT_SPREAD, INLINE_FRAGMENT
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query @skip(if: true) { user { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "@skip" is not allowed on QUERY

  Rule: Directive arguments are validated

    Scenario: Missing required directive argument raises compile error
      Given a schema where "@skip" requires argument "if" of type "Boolean!"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user @skip { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating required argument "if" is missing on "@skip"

    Scenario: Wrong directive argument type raises compile error
      Given a schema where "@skip" requires argument "if" of type "Boolean!"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user @skip(if: \"yes\") { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating type mismatch for argument "if" on "@skip"

  Rule: Non-repeatable directives must not be duplicated

    Scenario: Repeated non-repeatable directive raises compile error
      Given a schema where "@skip" is non-repeatable
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user @skip(if: true) @skip(if: false) { name } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "@skip" cannot be repeated

  # --- Inline Fragment Validation ---

  Rule: Type conditions must reference valid types in context

    Scenario: Valid inline fragment on union member compiles
      Given a schema union "SearchResult" of types "User" and "Post"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { search { ... on User { name } ... on Post { title } } }"
      Then the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Invalid type condition raises compile error
      Given a schema union "SearchResult" of types "User" and "Post"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { search { ... on Comment { body } } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "Comment" is not a member of union "SearchResult"

  # --- Input Object Validation (inline literals only — variable contents are runtime) ---

  Rule: Inline input object fields must exist in the input type definition

    Scenario: Non-existent field in inline input literal raises compile error
      Given a schema input "CreateUserInput" with fields "name" and "email"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "mutation { createUser(input: {name: \"Alice\", phone: \"123\"}) { id } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "phone" does not exist on input "CreateUserInput"

    Scenario: Valid inline input literal compiles
      Given a schema input "CreateUserInput" with fields "name" and "email"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "mutation { createUser(input: {name: \"Alice\"}) { id } }"
      Then the module compiles successfully

  Rule: Required fields in inline input literals must be provided

    Scenario: Missing required field in inline input literal raises compile error
      Given a schema input "CreateUserInput" with required field "name: String!" and optional field "email: String"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "mutation { createUser(input: {email: \"a@b.com\"}) { id } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating required field "name" is missing on "CreateUserInput"

  Rule: Inline input object fields must be unique

    Scenario: Duplicate field in inline input literal raises compile error
      Given a schema input "CreateUserInput"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "mutation { createUser(input: {name: \"Alice\", name: \"Bob\"}) { id } }"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating duplicate field "name" on "CreateUserInput"

  Rule: Enum values must be valid members

    Scenario: Valid enum value compiles
      Given a schema enum "Role" with values "ADMIN" and "USER"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with a variable or literal using "ADMIN"
      Then the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Invalid enum value raises compile error
      Given a schema enum "Role" with values "ADMIN" and "USER"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with a literal enum value "SUPERADMIN"
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "SUPERADMIN" is not a valid value for enum "Role"

  # --- Custom Scalar Validation ---

  Rule: Custom scalars must have a configured Ecto Type mapping or built-in

    Scenario: Custom scalar with Ecto Type module compiles successfully
      Given a schema with custom scalar "DateTime"
      And the client module is configured with scalars %{"DateTime" => MyApp.Types.DateTime}
      And MyApp.Types.DateTime implements Ecto.Type
      When the developer writes ~GQL referencing a "DateTime" field
      Then the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Built-in Ecto Type scalar compiles without explicit mapping
      Given a schema with custom scalar "DateTime"
      And TypedGql provides a built-in Ecto Type for "DateTime"
      And no explicit scalar mapping is configured
      When the developer writes ~GQL referencing a "DateTime" field
      Then the module compiles successfully using the built-in

    Scenario: Unknown custom scalar without mapping or built-in raises compile error
      Given a schema with custom scalar "CustomFoo"
      And no scalar mapping is configured for "CustomFoo"
      And no built-in Ecto Type exists for "CustomFoo"
      When the developer writes ~GQL referencing a "CustomFoo" field
      Then a compile error is raised indicating "CustomFoo" has no configured mapping

  # --- Error Locations ---

  Rule: Validation errors include line and column positions within the GraphQL string

    Scenario: Error points to the offending field's line and column
      Given a schema with type "User" having fields "name" and "email"
      When the developer writes a multi-line ~GQL with "nonExistent" on line 3, column 5
      Then the compile error message includes "(3:5)" indicating the position in the GraphQL string

  Rule: Error positions are offset by the caller's Elixir source line

    Scenario: Error line is offset by the defgql call site line
      Given a defgql call on line 50 of an Elixir file
      And the GraphQL string has an error on line 3
      Then the compile error points to line 53 (50 + 3) in the Elixir file
      And the column remains relative to the GraphQL string

  # --- Deprecation Warnings ---

  Rule: Deprecated fields produce compile warnings

    Scenario: Using a deprecated field emits a compile warning
      Given a schema where field "oldEmail" on type "User" is deprecated with reason "use email instead"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { oldEmail } }"
      Then a compile warning is emitted indicating "oldEmail" on "User" is deprecated with reason "use email instead"
      And the warning includes the line and column position of "oldEmail"
      And the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Non-deprecated fields produce no warning
      Given a schema where field "email" on type "User" is not deprecated
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { email } }"
      Then no deprecation warning is emitted

  Rule: Deprecated arguments produce compile warnings

    Scenario: Using a deprecated argument emits a compile warning
      Given a schema where argument "legacyId" on field "user" is deprecated with reason "use id instead"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user(legacyId: \"old\") { name } }"
      Then a compile warning is emitted indicating "legacyId" is deprecated with reason "use id instead"
      And the module compiles successfully

  Rule: Deprecated enum values produce compile warnings

    Scenario: Using a deprecated enum value emits a compile warning
      Given a schema enum "Status" where value "LEGACY" is deprecated with reason "use INACTIVE"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with a literal enum value "LEGACY"
      Then a compile warning is emitted indicating "LEGACY" on "Status" is deprecated with reason "use INACTIVE"
      And the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Deprecated enum value in a list argument emits a compile warning
      Given a schema enum "Role" where value "GUEST" is deprecated
      And a field accepts argument "roles" of type "[Role]"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { usersByRoles(roles: [ADMIN, GUEST]) { name } }"
      Then a compile warning is emitted for the deprecated "GUEST" value

  Rule: Deprecated input object fields produce compile warnings

    Scenario: Using a deprecated input field emits a compile warning
      Given a schema input "CreateUserInput" where field "nickname" is deprecated with reason "use displayName"
      When the developer writes ~GQL with an inline input literal containing "nickname"
      Then a compile warning is emitted indicating "nickname" on "CreateUserInput" is deprecated with reason "use displayName"
      And the module compiles successfully

    Scenario: Deprecated nested input field emits a compile warning
      Given a schema input "ProfileInput" where field "oldAvatar" is deprecated
      And "ProfileInput" is nested inside another input type
      When the developer writes ~GQL with an inline input literal containing "oldAvatar"
      Then a compile warning is emitted for the deprecated "oldAvatar" field

  Rule: Deprecation reason is optional

    Scenario: Deprecated field without reason emits warning without suffix
      Given a schema where field "email" on type "User" is deprecated without a reason
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { email } }"
      Then a compile warning is emitted indicating "email" on "User" is deprecated
      And the warning message does not include a reason suffix

    Scenario: Deprecated field with empty string reason omits suffix
      Given a schema where field "email" on type "User" is deprecated with reason ""
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user { email } }"
      Then a compile warning is emitted indicating "email" on "User" is deprecated
      And the warning message does not include a reason suffix

    Scenario: Deprecated argument without reason emits warning without suffix
      Given a schema where argument "legacyId" on field "user" is deprecated without a reason
      When the developer writes ~GQL with "query { user(legacyId: \"old\") { name } }"
      Then a compile warning is emitted indicating "legacyId" is deprecated
      And the warning message does not include a reason suffix
